#### Hello, thanks for checking out my website.

I'm Leo Duan. I'm a statistician and an assistant professor working at University of Florida since 2018. Prior to that, I obtained my PhD in Mathematics at University of Cincinnati in 2015 under the supervision of Rhonda Szczesniak and Xia Wang, worked a year as a data scientist in the tech sector, and spent two years as a postdoc working with David Dunson at Johns Hopkins and Duke University.
