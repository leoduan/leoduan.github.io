Hey y'all, I'm an assistant professor of Statistics at University of Florida.

# Research Interest
My research group focus on the methods and theory of the ***Bayesian Combinatorial Inferences***.

Combinatorial objects are very common in statistics and machine learning, for
example, clustering, multi-scale partitioning, tree graphs, networks,
change-point/boundary detection, etc.  A major challenge is in the high
complexity of the parameter space, due to the discreteness and combinatorial
constraints. My research group have been discovering / building a set of
interesting mathematical tools that can directly bypass the combinatorial
hurdles, letting us develop models and theory that were previously unthinkable.
