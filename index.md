# Leo Li Duan

I'm an assistant professor of Statistics at University of Florida.

My research group focus on the methods and theory of the *Combinatorial Inferences*.

Combinatorial objects are very common in statistics and machine learning, for
example, clustering, multi-scale partitioning, tree-graphs, networks,
change-point/boundary detection, etc.  A major challenge is in the high
complexity of the parameter space, due to discreteness and combinatorial
constraints. My research group have discovered an interesting set of useful mathematical
tools that can bypass the combinatorial hurdles, letting us to build models and
theory that were previously unthinkable.
