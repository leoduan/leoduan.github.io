#### Hello, thanks for checking out my website.

I'm Leo Duan. I'm a statistician and an assistant professor at University of Florida since 2018.

My research aims to build new statistical methods, theory and computational toolboxes for addressing motivating application problems in 
neuroscience, engineering, and transportation science. The main statistical interest is in modeling the combinatorial objects that are routinely
used in science and engineering (e.g., tree graphs, clustering, signal pathways, integer flow networks, etc.).
Our research generates interesting solutions at the intersection between combinatorics, optimization, and Bayesian statistics.

**My CV can be found** [here](leo_duan_cv.pdf)  (updated 2024 Oct)



## Some annoucements!

Prof. Jason Xu and I are teaching a short course "Harnessing Optimization in Bayesian Inference" at JSM 2025 in Nashville Tennessee. Stay tuned for further detail.
