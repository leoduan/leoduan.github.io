#### Hello, thanks for checking out my website.

I'm Leo Duan. I'm a statistician and an Associate Professor at the University of Florida.

My research focuses on the interface between optimization and Bayes.

The goal of our research group is to develop new statistical and machine learning toolboxes that _just work_ -- which means simple implementation, fast computation, and principled uncertainty quantification.

Achieving this goal is not trivial, which is why we've been working to show how one can borrow strengths from two communities: Bayes, who are good at probabilistic modeling, and optimization, who are good at efficient computing. Check out our work below on building optimization-based priors, optimization-based  likelihoods, and optimization-based generative models, and feel free to reach out with any questions.

My statisical interest is largely motivated by ongoing collaborative work in neuroscience, engineering, and transportation science.

## Some annoucements!

* I have been elected to serve as Treasurer of ISBA, beginning in 2026.
Thank you all for your trust and support. I look forward to continuing to serve ISBA and and the broader statistical community.
